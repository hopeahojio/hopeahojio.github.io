            <h2>Funny Groundhog</h2>
                  <p>A funny video that I saw recently was of this groundhog eating this person's crops right in front of the camera - and with such attitude at some points in the video!</p>

            <h2>COW!</h2>
                  <p>In my quest for amusing websites, I came accross this website. All it's about is finding a cow </p>

            <h2>Third Website</h2>
                  <p>When I think of funny videos on the web, this is usually the first one that comes to mind.  Everyone's sense of humor is different, but maybe you'll find it hilarious as well!  To save you time, this link should skip straight to where the funniness starts in the video</p>

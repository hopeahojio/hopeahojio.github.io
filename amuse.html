            <h2>Funny Groundhog</h2>
                  <p>A funny video that I saw recently was of this groundhog eating this person's crops in front of their security camera - and with such attitude at some points in the video!</p>

            <h2>COW!</h2>
                  <p>In my quest for amusing websites, I came accross this website. All it's about is finding a cow. As your cursor gets closer to the cow, the sounds gets more frantic (kind of like the warmer/colder game). Then, when you find the cow: Moo!</p>

            <h2>The Useless Web</h2>
                  <p>The internet has a lot to offer, which includes websites with no <i>real use</i>. Some of them are pretty funny! If you click the button in the link below, it takes you to one of those.</p>

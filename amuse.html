            <h2>First Website</h2>
                  <p>A funny video that I saw recently was of this groundhog eating this person's crops right in front of the camera - and with such attitude at some points in the video!</p>

            <h2>Second Website</h2>
                  <p>This link is of a Zelda vending machine gif that I really liked. I'm just getting into this series, so I don't understand all of the references, but I thought that it was really cool art nonetheless!</p>
                  <p>I linked straight to the gif, but the link below is the original post I found.</p>

            <h2>Third Website</h2>
                  <p>When I think of funny videos on the web, this is usually the first one that comes to mind.  Everyone's sense of humor is different, but maybe you'll find it hilarious as well!  To save you time, this link should skip straight to where the funniness starts in the video</p>

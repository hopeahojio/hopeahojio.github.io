        		What truly makes a hero is the attributes that they embody, even through the most difficult circumstances.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		Some of those attributes of which I admire are:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
        		<li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
        		<li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        		<li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
        		<li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than Martin Luther King. He called people to be accountable for the racial prejudices that we all carry. He demonstrated that violence is not the best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed everything to make the world better.

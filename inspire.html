        		What truly makes a hero is the attributes that they embody, even through the most difficult circumstances.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		Some of those attributes of Malala which I admire include:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
			<li>Perseverance - Even in the face of enormous difficulty, she continued</li>
        		<li>Passion - By speaking out on topics that need attention and awareness, she engages in activism for female education</li>
			<li>Braveness - For the sake of other people, she speaks out to help bring forth justice and inclusion</li>
			<li>Leaving a legacy - Because of the efforts put forth, she is paving the way for others</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Malala Yousafazai, even from a young age, faced numerous obstacles, but persevered. She exemplifies everything that a hero could be.
